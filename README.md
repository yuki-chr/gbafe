Hi! I'm Snow (aka Yuki) and this is my GBAFE code repo. At the moment I have made only a single hack but maybe it will be more populated in the future, who knows.

### FE8 Death Dance
As the name suggests, this is a simple hack that ports the FE6 mechanic to FE8.

If you don't know what it is, basically it makes it so that if a unit which was rescuing another unit dies during its faction's turn, the rescued unit will be active and able to act instead of being greyed out, allowing for some interesting tech if you're willing to sacrifice units.

If you spot any bugs or unintended behaviour be sure to let me know on the FEUniverse discord, I'll try to fix it as soon as possible!
